This map depicts tweets across the United States that are related to the keyword 'playlist'. Using a Twitter API crawler, tweets with attributed geographic locations were collected and then mapped using QGIS. 

In analyzing the tweets that are shown, it is clear that the West and East Coasts are the locations in which there are the most tweets pertaining to playlists. While the Twitter Crawler is not an all encompassing API, there is enough data to find patterns in geography. The Industrial Midwest is more spread out in terms of tweets, with still a sizable number of tweets, while the center left of the United States containing Montana and Idaho shows little interest in designated topic. This could mean that there is a greater interest in speaking about playlists within heavily-pop-culture-loving states. The West and East Coasts are known for their prominent entertainment industries, which could contribute to the greater surge in areas like southern California.

In general, this could be also a predictor of where Twitter is typically used. If other data is pulled of different keywords, there would be a better confirmation of whether playlist is just a popular keyword in these specific locations, or whether Twitter in general is mostly used in those areas.
